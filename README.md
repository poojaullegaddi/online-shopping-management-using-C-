Online shopping is all about calculating the total amount for the items selected by the customer.
APPROACH
Firstly a menu will be displayed to the customer showing all the available product categories and checkout options.
After the selection, all the products with their prices will be displayed.
Then the customer will select the products they want to buy.
This process continues until the shopping is completed and the customer clicks on the check-out button.
Whenever the customer completes his shopping, the items, quantity, cost, and finally the total amount to be paid are displayed.
